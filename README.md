## Project 1 - Collision Avoidance
In the first project of IAJ, the goal was to implement and test several collision avoidance algorithms, including the AvoidCharacter, AvoidObstacle and Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle methods lectured.

## Project 2 - Pathfinding
In the second project of IAJ, the goal was to implement several pathfinding algorithms. More specifically, A*, NodeArray A* and JPS+.

## Project 3 - Decision Making
In the third project of IAJ, the goal was to implement Decision Making algorithms into a game-scenario. More specifically, Depth-Limited GOAP and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (with and without the RAVE variant). A world representation was also built in accordance to the FEAR world model.

## Project 4 - ML Agents
In the fourth (open) project of IAJ, the goal I set out for myself was to use Unity's ML-Agents framework in order to train an A.I agent to play the classic game Asteroids using Reinforcement Learning (PPO).
